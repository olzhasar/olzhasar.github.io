Summary: If you used only Django for your web projects and never tried Flask, you may be losing a lot of learning opportunities
Status: draft

I started my journey in web development with Django. That was the first framework that Iâ€™ve learned right after familiarizing myself with a bit of Python programming language. Shortly, I wrote a couple of web applications with it. I was so fascinated by the fact that I can build a full-featured website in a couple of days or sometimes hourse dependning on complexity. Django served me well. I remember trying Flask once back then. It seemed hard and confusing too me. On the other hand, Django I used Django as a main tool at every job since then. And after several years, I finally dived deep into Flask and realized that using only Django was the wrong choice from the very beginning.
