## Intro

I started my journey in web development with Django. That was the first framework that Iâ€™ve learned right after familiarizing myself with a bit of Python programming language. Shortly, I was able to write a couple of web applications with it. I was so fascinated by the fact that I can build a full-featured website in a couple of days or sometimes hours dependning on project complexity. I remember trying Flask once back then. It seemed really hard and confusing too me. On the other hand, Django was super intuitive to and easy to start with.

## Second try

After several years of working with Django both at my job and for personal projects, I finally decided to give Flask another try. I was already a middle engineer at that point, knowing something about servers, databases and software design. I started a toy project and started to build a project. And I totally fell in love with the process. Flask gave me complete freedom over my project and I utilized that freedom to design application that would suit my every need. I used Flask for almost every personal project since then and I learned a lot while developing them. I finally came to a realization that choosing Flask at the very beginning of my career would be a much more beneficial decision in terms of skills development.

Let's walk over some points where I personally think Flask can be more enlightening to any backend engineer compared to Django.

## Design philosophy

Django is an absolutely beautiful piece of software. It comes battery-included and covers almost every use case a modern backend engineer can face. But it does all that Django-way. Let me explain what I mean by that.
