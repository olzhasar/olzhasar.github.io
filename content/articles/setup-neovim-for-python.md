Summary: Neovim is awesome. Let's set it up for efficient Python development!

If you happen to be a Neovim (or plain Vim) fan like myself, I don't need to explain you how great this editor is. It's a very reliable swiss knife that will never let you down. But when it comes to developing large projects, can Neovim really compete with all these fancy modern fully-featured IDEs like PyCharm or VSCode? The answer is a strong YES, but we need to make a little a bit of a setup for that. In this article, I will show you some tools that I use on a daily basis with Neovim for developing in Python (and other languages).

First of all, what do we really need from a modern IDE besides really basic things like syntax highlighting? I personally came up with the following features:

- Project management
- Convinient way of working with git
- Fuzzy file finding
- Code autocompletion

And luckily, all of these features are

## Fuzzy file finding

There is

## Vim-Obsession

## Working with git
