title: About me

Hi, I'm **Olzhas Arystanov**.

I'm a software engineer focused on backend development. I am passionate about building various types of applications, from small handy cli tools to large monoliths and distributed systems.

Most of my experience revolves around Python, but I also work with Go, TypeScript, C, and even Lua.

I'm a huge advocate of test-driven development (TDD) - I enjoy it so much that I even created a [tool that helps with it](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-watcher/).

You can find me on:
