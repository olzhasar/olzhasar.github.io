E-commerce application for a company selling designer bouquettes. 

Website for comparing financial products from commercial banks, insurance & brokerage companies, etc. Users can filter and compare financial products based on their specific requirements. For example, user can specify a desired loan amount and application calculates monthly payments effective annual interest rate (EAR) and total repayment amount. Vue.js has been chosen as front-end framework to ensure smooth user experience during filtering and comparing products. Back-end is powered by django and django-rest-framework.

This is my personal side project and is under development currently. I am the owner and the only software engineer of this project at the moment.
