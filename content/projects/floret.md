E-commerce application for a company selling designer bouquettes. 

Custom e-commerce engine was written from scratch using django framework. Template from themeforest was used on the front-end side.
Implemented integration with payment processing system and e-mail delivery service (SendinBlue).
Django administrative interface was customized and served as a complete store management system.

Designed online store successfully works from the year 2016 and several redesigns and improvements were made since then (by myself).
