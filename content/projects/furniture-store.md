E-commerce web application for custom furniture manufacturing company. Besides building it's own online store, business also needed a way to engage it's various partner on their platform. In order to implement marketstore-like behavior of the final product and provide core e-commerce features out of the box without reinventing the wheel, django-oscar has been chosen as a framework. A lot of modifications have been made in order to fully fit customer's business model and final product requirements.
