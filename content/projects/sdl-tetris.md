I have developed a `Tetris` clone entirely from scratch using the C programming language. The primary objective of this project was to enhance my C programming skills. To handle the graphics, I made use of the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library.

I've also ported this game to WebAssembly. You can check out an online demo [available here](https://tetris.olzhasar.com/).

To explore the source code of the project, feel free to visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/olzhasar/sdl-tetris).
