Summary: Employee engagement platform

Web application for a startup providing employee engagement services for corporate customers. The goal of the company was to aggregate diferrent discounts and special offers from various vendors and provide them as a package to companies. That way small and medium-sized companies can provide their employees with corporate perks comparable to the level of large corporations.

Application has 2 different interfaces: for members (employees of customer's companies) and vendors (providers of the offers).

Members that have access to the platform, can view all the perks and select those they like. After pressing "Get this perk" button a unique transaction code has been generated that was sent to the member's email.

Vendors can view and manage transactions for their offers in a separate user interface.

There is also a dashboard for company's administrator that can manage employees on the platform, analyze their platform-related activity.

Back-end for this platform was implemented using django framework. Javascript and Bootstrap was used on the front-end side. Integration with sendgrid API for email deliveries was made.

I was the technical co-founder of this project responsible for developing the platform.

Unfortunately, this project was discontinued due to lack of demand from local businesses.
