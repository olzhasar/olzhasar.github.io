This is a hobby project that I have been working on for a while. It is a simple web application that allows users to keep track of their investments. It only supports equities from the S&P 500 index for the moment. Financial data is regularly updated from the remote API and saved locally.

Users can manage their portfolio holdings, see performance metrics and view stock price charts.

Technologies used:

- Python
- Django
- SQLite
- HTMX
- Tailwind CSS
- ApexCharts
