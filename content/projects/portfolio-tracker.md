Title: Portfolio Tracker
date: 2024-02-20

This is a hobby project that I have been working on for a while. It is a simple portfolio tracker that allows users to keep track of their investments. Financial data is fetched from the remote API using a cron job and stored in the local SQLite database.

Users can manage their portfolio holdings, view stock price charts, and see basic performance metrics.

Technologies used:

- Python
- Django
- SQLite
- HTMX (for reactivity without much JavaScript)
- Tailwind CSS
