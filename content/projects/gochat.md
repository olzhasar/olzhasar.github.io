I have built a simple web messenger using the Go  programming language on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend. The primary objective of this project was to enhance my concurrency skills in Go.

The application allows users to send and receive messages in real-time in a chat room. Each room has a unique URL, and users can join the room by visiting the URL. The application is built using the following technologies:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)

To explore the source code of the project, feel free to visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/olzhasar/gochat).
