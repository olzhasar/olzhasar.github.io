pytest-watcher is an open-source tool designed to streamline the pytest workflow by automatically running tests whenever changes are made to \*.py files within a project.

As a strong advocate of the test-driven development approach, I frequently execute tests throughout my regular development cycle. This tool has proven invaluable in eliminating the need for manual tests invocation.

You can find the library on PyPi at the following link:
