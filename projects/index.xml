The primary objective of this project was to enhance my concurrency skills in Go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The application allows users to send and receive messages in real-time in a chat room. Each room has a unique URL, and users can join the room by visiting the URL. The application is built using the following technologies:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Portfolio Tracker</title><link>/projects/portfolio-tracker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/portfolio-tracker/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/portfolio-tracker.png" alt="Preview">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a hobby project that I have been working on for a while. It is a simple web application that allows users to keep track of their investments. It only supports equities from the S&amp;amp;P 500 index for the moment. Financial data is regularly updated from the remote API and saved locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Users can manage their portfolio holdings, see performance metrics and view stock price charts.&lt;/p>

The primary objective of this project was to enhance my C programming skills. To handle the graphics, I made use of the &lt;a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2&lt;/a> library.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also ported this game to WebAssembly. You can check out an online demo &lt;a href="https://tetris.olzhasar.com/">available here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a strong advocate of the test-driven development approach, I frequently execute tests throughout my regular development cycle, so I&amp;rsquo;ve built this simple tool to avoid manual repetitive test invocations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find the library on PyPi at the following link:&lt;/p>
